Configuration
=============

1. Insert ``django_generic_flatblocks`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your
   settings. 
   
2. Make sure that ``django.core.context_processors.request`` is active.
   In a project generated by ``django-admin.py startproject`` this is not the
   case, so you may have to define ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` in your settings.
   The context processor is needed to determine if a user has the permissions to edit 
   a generic-flatblock.
   Have a look at the example_project for sensible defaults.
   You can also find the default context processors in ``django.conf.global_settings`` 
   (``'django.core.context_processors.request'`` is commented out here).
   
3. (optional) Define the url prefix to your contrib.admin installation in the
   setting ``ADMIN_URL_PREFIX``. Most commonly this is ``/admin/``. Beware
   the trailing slash.
  
4. Resync your database: ``./manage.py syncdb``
